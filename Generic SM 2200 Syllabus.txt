Course Requirements and Assignments



Module Quizzes: 

There are no exams in this class.  The primary assessment method is a quiz for each chapter in the textbook.  This is a history class, and you can look up history.  So, you may have access to your textbook and the PowerPoint presentations during the quizzes.  

Each quiz contains varying amounts of questions.  The enforced time limit for each quiz is three minutes per question.  For example, if a quiz consists of ten questions, then the enforced time limit is 30 minutes.  If a quiz contains twenty questions, then the enforced time limit is 60 minutes.  Each quiz also has a three-minute grace period for you to complete your work if you go over the specified time limit.  After the grace period, you will not be allowed to make changes to the quiz.

My recommendation for you to be successful in this class is simple – read the textbook!  This should not be a difficult class.  Read the chapters and review the presentations before taking the quizzes.  If you do not know the answer to a question immediately, then you should be familiar enough with the material to quickly find the answer in the textbook or the PowerPoint presentation.

Due dates for all quizzes can be found in the course outline.  

Your average grade on the four quizzes from section I accounts for 18% of your final grade.  Your average grade on the four quizzes from section II accounts for 18% of your final grade.  Your average grade on the four quizzes from section III accounts for 18% of your final grade.  Your average grade on the two quizzes from section IV accounts for 18% of your final grade.  Your average grade on the three quizzes from section V accounts for 18% of your final grade.  Thus, in total, your grades on the quizzes account for 90% of your final grade in this class.  So, it is of great importance that you read the chapters and do well on the quizzes.

Graded Discussion Boards: 

Each chapter module contains one discussion topic.  However, you are not required to participate in every discussion topic.  This is so you can choose to participate in discussions about which you are more enthusiastic.

For each section, you are required to post on at least one discussion topic.  Also, for each section, you are required to comment on at least one of your fellow students’ posts.  These do not need to be on the same topic.  For example, in section I, you may choose to make a post on the topic provided in the chapter 1 module.  For your one comment on a fellow student’s post, you may choose to comment on a post made on the topic provided in the chapter 3 module.  If you did this, you will have done everything you need to do to satisfy these requirements for section I.

Thus, you are required to make one post and one comment from the four discussion topics provided in section I.  You are required to make one post and one comment from the four discussion topics provided in section II.  You are required to make one post and one comment from the four discussion topics provided in section III.  You are required to make one post and one comment from the two discussion topics provided in section IV.  Finally, you are required to make one post and one comment from the three discussion topics provided in section V.  

Due dates for all discussion-topic assignments can be found in the course outline.  Your average grade on all discussion assignments accounts for 10% of your final grade in the course.

Course Policies


Attendance is not required.

Late Quizzes:
If a student does not submit a quiz on time, then they can request to submit the quiz late.  Late quizzes will be awarded 50% credit if submitted before December 2 at 11:00 P.M.  Thus, your grade on the quiz will be multiplied times 0.5, and that will be your grade on the quiz.

After December 2 at 11:00 PM, no late quizzes will be accepted.  All unsubmitted quizzes will receive a grade of zero.

Late Graded Discussion Boards:
No graded discussion-board assignments will be accepted after the specified due dates.  Thus, you must complete these assignments on time.

Graded Discussion Board Early Submissions: 
Since the graded discussion boards cannot be submitted late, I am offering an incentive for students to submit them early.  Essentially, this is to encourage students to not forget to submit their graded discussion boards before the specified due dates.  Any student completing their two posts and two comments for one of the three discussion assignments one week before the specified due date will be given 10 bonus points on the assignment.  The early submission deadlines for earning these bonus points are as follows:

Section I Discussion Assignment: August 30 at 11:00 PM

Section II Discussion Assignment: September 22 at 11:00 PM

Section III Discussion Assignment: October 17 at 11:00 PM

Section IV Discussion Assignment: November 1 at 11:00 PM

Section V Discussion Assignment: November 25 at 11:00 PM
